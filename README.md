# rtl2mqtt

This is an enhanced version of rtl2mqtt script from https://github.com/roflmao/rtl2mqtt.

Modifications/enhancements are:
 * Introduced command line options allowing for more flexibility
 * Streamline MQTT mesg contect, e.g. no time stamp

PS The Dockerfile is untouched and not checked since I don't run Docker. It might work or not.
